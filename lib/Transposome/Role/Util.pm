=head1 METHODS

=head2 mk_key

 Title   : mk_key
 Usage   : my $key = mk_key('string1','string2');
          
 Function: Safely creates a string of joined strings
           to be used (internally) as a hash key. Could
           also be used in comparisons. This uses standard
           ascii characters whereas previous versions relied
           on unicode characters (which may be safer but is
           much slower).

                                                           Return_type
 Returns : A string comprising the input                   Scalar

                                                           Arg_type
 Args    : An array of strings                             Array

=cut

sub mk_key {
    my $self = shift;
    my (@arg) = @_;
    return join "~~", map { $_ // " " } @arg;
}

=head2 mk_vec

 Title   : mk_vec
 Usage   : my @vec = mk_vec('some_joined_string');
          
 Function: Creates an array out of a string.
                  
                                                           Return_type                                  
 Returns : An array comprised of the elements              Array
           joined in the input string

                                                           Arg_type
 Args    : A string                                        Scalar

=cut

sub mk_vec {
    my $self = shift;
    my ($key) = @_;
    return split /\~\~/, $key;
